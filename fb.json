I called the SU this morning and they suggested Photo Soc (I didn't even know the society existed otherwise I would have come here first) but they also said it may be impossible due to the short notice. We mainly need the photographers just for the red carpet entrance so just between 18.00 and 20.00, so the rest of your Saturday night is free (although you are welcome to stay longer) and we can provide transport to and from the hotel from Leamington or Campus. My hands are really tied in terms of budget for photography as I have just had to book a photographer for the whole night to cover the whole event who I've had to pay over the odds because of the short notice. However, if the photographers wish to stay later at the event, food can also be arranged for them.\n\nI know the notice is unbelievably short, I wish this wasn't the case but I am desperately pursuing all options available to me so if any of your members are available for those hours and are interested could someone get in contact with me on:\n07904336866 or;\njaymbakwe@hotmail.com or;\nsend me a facebook message, carrier pidgeon, anything!\n\nThank you and hoping for a positive response!\nJason x",
